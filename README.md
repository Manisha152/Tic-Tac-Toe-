# Tic Tac Toe Game 

# Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using python. The primary goal is to create a program that allows two players to play against each other. It's a fun and strategic game that can be enjoyed by friends and family.

# Game Description
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking the squares on the grid with their symbols. The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- Game Grid: The game is played on a 3x3 board.
- Winning Condition: To win, a player needs to have three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- Player Options:
    - Player 1: The first player.
    - Player 2: The second player.

# Game Rules
- Players choose between the symbols "X" and "O."
- Player 1 plays first and uses the "X" mark, while Player 2 plays second and uses the "O" mark.
- Players take turns making moves, with Player 1 starting.
- A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with their mark ("X" or "O") with the intention of creating a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The game ends with two possible outcomes:
    - One player successfully gets three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) and wins the game.
    - If no player can create a straight line with their own mark, the game ends in a draw/tie.
